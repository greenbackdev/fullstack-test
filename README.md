# Genesis Fullstack Test

This repository is the starting point for a live-coding session.

## Techonogies

This repository is a Next.js application written in Typescript. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
You can get familiar with the technologies beforehand, but please do not start the exercise before our live session.

You'll be sharing your screen and can use the text editor of your choice.

To start coding, run the follwing commands:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Exercise

The `/data` directory contains some JSON data files. You can get familiar with the schema before starting the exercise.

- `data/indicators.json` contains the description of our indicators and indexes.
- `data/dependencies.json` contains the dependencies between our indexes, indicators, and measures.

You will be asked to write a small application that will:

- have a search bar that allows searching for an item (index, indicator)
- once an item is selected, display its description and dependencies
- when clicking on a dependency, show its page.

You may not have time to finish it all, the important is to be able to walk me through your choices and reasoning.
